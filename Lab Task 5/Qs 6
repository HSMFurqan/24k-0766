#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
int x;
x = 5 > 8 ? 10 : 1 != 2 < 5 ? 20 : 30;
printf("Value of x : %d",x);
return 0;
}
Explain why the output is 30
The output is 30 because: 
1. The first condition (5 > 8) is false, so we evaluate the second expression.
2. In the second expression, 1 != 2 < 5 evaluates to false (0).
3. Therefore, x is assigned the value that is after : and i.e 30, which is printed out .
