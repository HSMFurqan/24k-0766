The problem with code is that the value is defined as an integer which can only store 4-bits of data but the value is larger than 4-bits.
To solve this problem we can do it by initializing it as a long integer,in  the following way;

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
long testInteger=3000000000;
printf("Number is %ld",testInteger);
return 0;
}
