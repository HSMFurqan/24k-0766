When creating a program that takes input from user , the WHILE LOOP is better.
Here is an example 
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int userInput;
    int total = 0;
    while (1) {
    printf("Enter a number\n(0 to stop) : ");
    scanf("%d", &userInput);
    if (userInput == 0) {
        break;
        }
    total += userInput;
    printf("Current total : %d\n", total);
    }
    printf("Program ended.\nFinal total : %d", total);
    return 0;
}
You can see in this code you can take any input from user and it will add to it untill user write 0 .
It is because we don`t know number of iterations and it also checks condition (for when to stop) and other factors also .
